## Description

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, also known as OXO. The game allows two players to take turns placing their symbols ('X' or 'O') on a 3x3 grid. The goal is to be the first to create a line of three of your symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## How to Play

1. Launch the game in your web browser.
2. Click on an empty square on the grid to place your symbol ('X' or 'O').
3. The first player to create a line of three of their symbols wins the game.
4. If all squares are filled and no winner is determined, the game ends in a tie.
